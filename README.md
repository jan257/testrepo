# Simple Data Analysis in Python

This project demonstrates how to perform basic data analysis and visualization using Python libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Load a sample sales dataset.
- Perform basic data analysis, including summary statistics.
- Visualize sales trends using a line plot.

### Features
- **Data Manipulation**: We use `pandas` to load and manipulate data.
- **Summary Statistics**: Calculate basic statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and min/max values.
- **Data Visualization**: Use `matplotlib` to generate a simple line plot that visualizes sales trends over 6 months.
